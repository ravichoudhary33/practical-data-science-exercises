# [Practical Data Science, Course 15-388/688, Fall 2016](http://www.datasciencecourse.org/)
## Carnegie Mellon School of Computer Science

This repository is a collection of assignments from one of the most challenging yet valuable courses I've taken in Carnegie Mellon's CS department: [Practical Data Science](http://www.datasciencecourse.org/).

The markdown portions were provided by the instructors, but the the solutions (the code cells) are my original work. This class has sadly been discontinued since my graduation, so I at least wanted to share everything I learned in that course.
